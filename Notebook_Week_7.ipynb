    "\n",
    "Of course, Bob being a good friend of Alice, will help her to ensure that $K$ is truly random even if her devices are untrusted. That is, we will assume that Alice and Bob again have to separated devices on which they can perform a Bell test such as CHSH. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder whether this is at all useful. After all, Alice and Bob need a lot of randomness to perform the Bell test in the first place!. In QKD, we did not care since local randomness came for free: our challenge was to produce correlated and secret randomness!\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that using Bell tests, there does however exist a way for Alice and Bob to produce <i>more</i> randomness that they started out with: this precisely is the concept of randomness expansion. In randomness expansion, we start with a small amount of perfect randomness and want to produce more it. It turns out that by performing Bell tests we can produce more - in fact, exponentially more - randomness than we started with!\n",
    "\n",
    "While the analysis of such protocols is quite intricate, we will here explore the essential conceptual underpinning of randomness certification: if we violate a Bell inequality, then the outcomes are necessarily random!\n",
